# Data Science | Machine Learning Portfolio
This repository containing portfolio of data science machine learning projects completed by me for academic, and self learning purposes. Presented in the form of iPython Notebooks, and MATLAB.


## Contents

- ### Machine Learning

	- [Supervised Learning: Predicting IRIS types](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1sKpQJe5r_sl0VV6o7u23fy-XjtV1tNG_#scrollTo=wPmwAvoMElEH): A model to predict the IRIS types of humans of a given sepal length and width, and petal length and width utilizing machine learning.
	
	- [Deep Learning: Digit Sequence Recognition using CNNs](https://github.com/sajal2692/data-science-portfolio/blob/master/digit_recognition-mnist-sequence.ipynb):  Designing and implementing a Convolutional Neural Network that learns to recognize sequences of digits using synthetic data generated by concatenating images from MNIST.

	_Tools: scikit-learn, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Pygame_
