		- [Handwritten bangla digit recognition using CNN with WEB applet](https://github.com/shamim-ice/HandwrittenBanglaDigitRecognition): A project submitted to the department of Information and Communication Technology, Faculty of Engineering and Technology, Islamic University, Kushtia-7003 for the partial fulfilment of the bachelor schience degree.
		
		_Tools: Pandas, Numpy, cv2, Scikit-learn, keras, and Matplotlib_

		-[Number plate detection||Computer Vision|| Open cv](https://github.com/shamim-ice/NumberPlateDetection): Applying Open cv computer vision algorithm to detects Bangladeshi car number plate.
		
		- [Malicious users detection in CR-IoT networks using SVM](https://github.com/shamim-ice/SpectrumSensing-and-MaliciousUsersClassification): Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm used to detects and classifies malicious users in Cognitive Radio Internet of Things (CR-IoT) networks ([paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mlwa.2021.100052)).

	- __MATLAB__
		
		-This is my solution to all the programming assignments of Machine-Learning (Coursera) by Andrew Ng. Try to solve all the assignments by yourself first, but if you get stuck somewhere then feel free to browse the code.

		- [Linear Regression](https://github.com/shamim-ice/shamim_Portfolio/tree/main/Linear%20Regression): In this exercise, we implement linear regression with one variable to predict profits for a food truck, and with multiple variables to predict the prices of houses.
		- [Logistic Regression](https://github.com/shamim-ice/shamim_Portfolio/tree/main/Logistic%20Regression): In this exercise, we implement a logistic regression model to predict whether a student gets admitted into a university.
		- [Multi Class Classification and Neural Networks](https://github.com/shamim-ice/shamim_Portfolio/tree/main/Multi%20Class%20and%20NN): In this exercise, we use logistic regression and neural networks to recognize handwritten digits (from 0 to 9).
		- [Neural Network Learning](https://github.com/shamim-ice/shamim_Portfolio/tree/main/NN%20Learning): In this exercise, we implement a backpropagtion algorithm for neural networks and apply it to the task of handwritten digit recognition.
		- [Regularized Linear Regression and Bias Variance](https://github.com/shamim-ice/shamim_Portfolio/tree/main/Regularized%20Linear%20Regression%20and%20BiasVariance): In this exercise, we implement regularized linear regression to predict the amount of water flowing out of the dam using the change of water level. Also we plotted training and test errors on a learning curve to diagonse bias-variance problems.
		- [Support Vector Machine](https://github.com/shamim-ice/shamim_Portfolio/tree/main/Support%20Vector%20Machines): In this exercise, we find non-linear decision boundaries with SVM and build a spam classifier.
		- [K-means Clustering and PCM](https://github.com/shamim-ice/shamim_Portfolio/tree/main/K-Means%20Clustering%20and%20PCA): In this exercise, we implement K-means clustering algorithm and use it for image compression,  and use principal component analysis (PCA) to perform dimensionality reduction.
		
		- [Anomaly Detection](https://github.com/shamim-ice/shamim_Portfolio/tree/main/Anomaly%20Detection): In this exercise, we implement an anomaly detection algorithm and apply it to detect failing server on a network.
